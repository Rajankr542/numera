# PROGRESS

## 2026-09-29 — M2 creation, M3 shape, first measured optimizations

Done:
- C++ `native/core/creation.{hpp,cpp}`: `full`, `ones`, `arange` (NumPy fill
  semantics), `linspace`, `eye`. `native/core/shape_ops.{hpp,cpp}`:
  `transpose`, `squeeze`, `expand_dims`, `swapaxes`, `moveaxis`, `ravel`,
  `flatten`, `normalize_axes`. Bindings are in `native/bindings/ops_binding.cpp`.
- TS: `asarray`, `ones`, `full`, `arange`, `linspace`, `eye`, `identity`,
  `zerosLike`/`onesLike`/`emptyLike`/`fullLike`, `shape.ts` functions, and the
  `NDArray` methods `transpose`, `T`, `squeeze`, `swapAxes`, `ravel`, `flatten`.
  Semantics are recorded in D-012.
- Performance (D-013, PERFORMANCE.md): calloc-backed zero buffers, a
  contiguous `astype` loop, and bulk `fromFloat64` for `np.array(list)`.
  Median at 1M float64 elements: `array(list)` 57.4 → 3.2 ms, `astype` 2.31 →
  0.40 ms, `zeros` 0.64 → 0.012 ms (allocation only). Corrected the wrong
  cause notes in PERFORMANCE.md.
- Verification (macOS arm64, Node 22.7, NumPy 2.5.3):
  - `pnpm build` passes.
  - `pnpm test:native` and `pnpm test:asan` pass (ASan+UBSan clean).
  - `pnpm test`: 42 tests pass.
  - `pnpm test:diff`: 884 cases pass, including new `ranges` (219) and
    `shape_ops` (64) groups.

## 2026-09-29 — PLAN §92 first task: end-to-end native NDArray

Done:
- C++ core (`native/core`): `MemoryBuffer`, `DType` + promotion table, shape/stride
  utilities, `NDArray` with views, copy, astype (unsafe casting), NumPy
  `_attempt_nocopy_reshape`, extent-based `may_share_memory`.
- Node-API bindings (`native/bindings`): `NDArray` wrapper; C++ errors mapped to
  typed JS errors (D-006).
- TypeScript package (`packages/nativpy`): `np.array/empty/zeros/fromTypedArray`,
  dtype objects, `promoteTypes`, `mayShareMemory`, `lib.stride_tricks.asStrided`.
- Tests, verified locally (macOS arm64, Node 22.7, NumPy 2.5.3):
  - `pnpm test:native`: C++ unit tests pass.
  - `pnpm test:asan`: C++ unit tests pass under ASan+UBSan, no reports.
  - `pnpm test`: 34 vitest tests pass.
  - `pnpm test:diff`: 601 NumPy differential cases pass (creation, astype, views,
    reshape, strided reshape, promote_types).
  - `pnpm typecheck` clean.

Issues the differential tests caught and I fixed (D-011): allocation strides for
empty arrays, reshape copying when NumPy returns a view, and `mayShareMemory`
semantics for empty or disjoint views.

Known gaps: see COMPATIBILITY.md. CI workflow is written but has not run yet
(no remote).
